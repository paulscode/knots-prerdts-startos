 * nothing to fix). The shared datadir carries the sibling's persisted

 * must be reconsidered or they pin this node to a stale chain across a
 * split. The runtime rdtsEnforcedLastRun marker detects the same transition
 * independently; setting the flag here makes the switch case deterministic
 * even if a prior run never recorded a marker.
 *

 * pins re-validates the RDTS-applicable range itself when it starts on a
 * datadir that advanced without enforcement.
